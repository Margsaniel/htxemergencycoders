The major water discharge of the Addicks and Barker Reservoirs occurred on 8-26-2017.

The first water gauge below the reservoir recorded a 22 foot rise in the Buffalo Bayou.

This was during just a 24 hour period which initiated the major flooding in West Houston.

In general, Buffalo Bayou started receeding around 9-10-2017 (16 days later).

The water gauge data for this is in the water_gauge_elevation.csv file.
